1. Download vechile sales data -> https://github.com/shashank-mishra219/Hive-Class/blob/main/sales_order_data.csv

2. Store raw data into hdfs location

3. Create a internal hive table "sales_order_csv" which will store csv data sales_order_csv .. make sure to skip header row while creating table

4. Load data from hdfs path into "sales_order_csv" 

5. Create an internal hive table which will store data in ORC format "sales_order_orc"

6. Load data from "sales_order_csv" into "sales_order_orc"


Perform below menioned queries on "sales_order_orc" table :

a. Calculatye total sales per year 
--Query-- select year_id, sum(sales) from sales_order_data_orc group by year_id;
b. Find a product for which maximum orders were placed 
--Query-- select productcode,count(ordernumber) cnt_of_orders from sales_order_data_orc group by productcode order by cnt_of_orders desc limit 1;
c. Calculate the total sales for each quarter 
--Query-- select qtr_id,sum(sales) from sales_order_data_orc group by qtr_id;
d. In which quarter sales was minimum 
--Query-- select qtr_id from (select qtr_id,sum(sales) total_sales from sales_order_data_orc group by qtr_id order by total_sales)t limit 1;
e. In which country sales was maximum and in which country sales was minimum 
--Query-- select country from (select country,sum(sales) total_sales, rank() over(order by sum(sales)) rn_lowst_sales, rank() over(order by sum(sales) desc) rn_hiest_sale from sales_order_data_orc group by country)t where rn_lowst_sales =1 or rn_hiest_sale =1;
f. Calculate quartelry sales for each city 
--Query-- select city,qtr_id,sum(sales) from sales_order_data_orc group by city,qtr_id;
h. Find a month for each year in which maximum number of quantities were sold 
--Query-- select year_id,month_id from (select year_id,month_id,sum(sales) total_sales, row_number() over(partition by year_id order by sum(sales) desc) rn from sales_order_data_orc group by year_id,month_id)t where rn=1;
